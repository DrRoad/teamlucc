number of clasess, or NULL (see Details).}

\code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame}. Defines the name of the column containing 
the observed cover class IDs}

model fit by \code{classify} with the \code{do_split} option selected}

\description{
Calculates a contingency table and various statistics for use in image 
classification accuracy assessment and map comparison. Contingency table 
includes user's, producer's, and overall accuracies for an image 
classification, and quantity disagreement \code{Q} and allocation 
disagreement \code{A}. \code{Q} and \code{A} are calculated based on Pontius 
and Millones (2011). Standard errors for 95 percent confidence intervals for 
the user's, producer's and overall accuracies are calculated as in Foody and 
Stehman (2009) Table 21.3. To avoid bias due to the use of a sample 
contingency table, the contingency table will be converted to a population 
contingency table if the variable 'pop' is provided. For an accuracy 
assessment using testing data from a simple random sample, 'pop' does not 
need to be provided (see Details).
}
\details{
\code{x} can be one of:
\enumerate{

\item A prediction model as output from one of the \code{teamlucc} 
  \code{classify} functions. If \code{x} is a model, and testing data 
  is included in the model, \code{pop} and \code{test_data} can both be 
  missing, and accuracy will still run (though the output will in this case 
  be biased unless the testing data is from a simple random sample). If 
  \code{x} is a \code{RasterLayer}, then \code{test_data} must be supplied.

\item A \code{RasterLayer} with a predicted map.
}

\code{test_data} can be one of:
\enumerate{
  \item \code{NULL}. If test_data is \code{NULL}, \code{accuracy} will try to use 
        testing data included in \code{x}. This will only work if \code{x}
        is a model of class \code{train} from the \code{caret} package, and 
        if the model was run using the one of the \code{teamlucc} 
        \code{classify} functions.

\item A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object, in which case \code{accuracy} 
        will extract the predicted classes within each polygon from \code{x}.  
        This will only work if \code{x} is a \code{RasterLayer}.

\item A \code{pixel_data} object, in which case \code{accuracy} will use the 
        included \code{training_flag} indicator to separate testing and 
        training data.
}

\code{pop} can be one of:
\enumerate{
  \item NULL, in which case the sample frequencies will be used as estimates 
        of the population frequencies of each class.

\item A list of length equal to the number of classes in the map giving 
        the total number of pixels in the population for each class.

\item A predicted cover map from as a \code{RasterLayer}, from which the 
        class frequencies will be tabulated and used as the population 
        frequencies.
