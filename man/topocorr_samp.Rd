\title{Topographic correction for satellite imagery}
\usage{
topocorr_samp(x, slope, aspect, sunelev, sunazimuth, method = "cosine",
  na.value = NA, IL.epsilon = 1e-06, sampleindices = NULL,
  DN_min = NULL, DN_max = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{image as a \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{slope}{the slope in radians as a \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{aspect}{the aspect in radians as a \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{sunelev}{sun elevation in degrees}

\item{sunazimuth}{sun azimuth in degrees}

\item{method}{the method to use for the topographic correction:
cosine, improvedcosine, minnaert, minslope, ccorrection, gamma, SCS, or 
illumination}

\item{na.value}{the value used to code no data values}

\item{IL.epsilon}{a small amount to add to calculated illumination values 
that are equal to zero to avoid division by zero resulting in Inf values}

\item{sampleindices}{(optional) row-major indices of sample pixels to use in 
regression models used for some topographic correction methods (like 
Minnaert). Useful when handling very large images. See
\code{\link{gridsample}} for one method of calculating these indices.}

\item{DN_min}{minimum allowable pixel value after correction (values less 
than \code{DN_min} are set to NA)}

\item{DN_max}{maximum allowable pixel value after correction (values less 
than \code{DN_max} are set to NA)}
}
\value{
RasterBrick with two layers: 'slope' and 'aspect'
}
\description{
Perform topographic correction using a number of different methods. This 
code is modified from the code in the \code{landsat} package by Sarah 
Goslee.  This version of the code has been altered from the \code{landsat} 
version to allow the option of using a sample of pixels for calculation of k 
in the Minnaert correction (useful when dealing with large images).
