\title{Extract observed data for use in a classification (training or testing)}
\usage{
get_pixels(x, polys, class_col, training = 1, src = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{Raster*} object from which observed data will be extracted.
The data will be extracted from each layer in a \code{RasterBrick} or 
\code{RasterStack}.}

\item{polys}{a \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} with polygons, each of which 
has been assigned to a particular class (using the values in 
\code{class_col})}

\item{class_col}{the name of the column containing the response variable 
(for example the land cover type of each pixel)}

\item{training}{indicator of which polygons to use in training. Can be: 1) a 
string giving the name of a column indicating whether each polygon is to be 
used in training (rows equal to 1) or in testing (rows equal to FALSE), or 
2) a logical vector of length equal to length(polys), or 3) a number between 
0 and 1 indicating the fraction of the polygons to be randomly selected for 
  use in training.}

\item{src}{name of this data source. Useful when gathering training 
data from multiple images.}
}
\value{
a \code{link{pixel_data}} object
will contain the the @examples
set.seed(1)
