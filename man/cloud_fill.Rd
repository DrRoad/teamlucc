\title{Cloud fill using the algorithm developed by Xiaolin Zhu}
\usage{
cloud_fill(cloudy, clear, cloud_mask, dims, num_class, min_pixel, max_pixel,
  cloud_nbh, DN_min, DN_max, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cloudy}{the cloudy image as a matrix, with pixels in columns (in 
column-major order) and with number of columns equal to number of bands}

\item{clear}{the clear image as a matrix, with pixels in columns (in 
column-major order) and with number of columns equal to number of bands}

\item{cloud_mask}{the cloud mask image as a vector (in column-major order), 
with clouds coded with unique integer codes starting at 1, and with areas 
that are clear in both images  coded as 0. Areas that are missing in the 
clear image, should be coded as -1.}

\item{dims}{the dimensions of the cloudy image as a length 3 vector: (rows, 
columns, bands)}

\item{num_class}{set the estimated number of classes in image}

\item{min_pixel}{the sample size of similar pixels}

\item{max_pixel}{the maximum sample size to search for similar pixels}

\item{cloud_nbh}{the range of cloud neighborhood (in pixels)}

\item{DN_min}{the minimum valid DN value}

\item{DN_max}{the maximum valid DN value}

\item{verbose}{whether to print detailed status messages}
}
\value{
array with cloud filled image with dims: cols, rows, bands
parameter, containing the selected textures measures
}
\description{
This function is called by the \code{\link{cloud_remove}} function. It is
not intended to be used directly.
