\title{Extract a set of Landsat tarballs into a folder tree organized by image date}
\usage{
espa_extract(in_folder, out_folder, pathrows = NULL, start_date = NULL,
  end_date = NULL, sensors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{in_folder}{Path to a folder of .tar.gz Landsat surface reflectance 
images}

\item{out_folder}{output folder}

\item{pathrows}{a list of paths/rows to include. Each path/row should be 
specified as a six digit string. For example, path 231, row 62 would be 
specified as "231062".}

\item{start_date}{start date of period from which images will be extracted
to (as \code{Date} object).}

\item{end_date}{end date of period from which images will be extracted
to (as \code{Date} object)}

\item{sensors}{a list of the sensors to include (can be any of "LT4", "LT5", 
"LE7", or "LC8")}
}
\value{
nothing (used for side effect of unzipping Landsat CDR tarballs)
}
\description{
Each image .tar.gz file will be extracted into a subfolder within 
\code{output_folder}. The subfolders will be named according to the year and 
Julian date of capture, and the sensor type (LT4, LT5 or LE7 for Landsat 4 
TM, Landsat 5 TM, and Landsat 7 ETM+ respectively). For example, 
"LT50150531986037-SC20130816144215.tar.gz" would be extracted into a 
subfolder named "1986_037_LT5', for 1986, Julian day 37, and Landsat 5 TM.
}
\details{
Zip files for images from sensors not included in \code{sensors}, from 
path/rows not included in \code{pathrows} or with acquisition dates
outside of the period defined by \code{start_date} and \code{end_date} will 
be ignored.
