\title{Topographic correction for satellite imagery using Minnaert method}
\usage{
minnaert_samp(x, slope, aspect, sunelev, sunazimuth, IL.epsilon = 1e-06,
  slopeclass = NULL, coverclass = NULL, sampleindices = NULL,
  DN_min = NULL, DN_max = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{image as a \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{slope}{the slope in radians as a \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{aspect}{the aspect in radians as a \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{sunelev}{sun elevation in degrees}

\item{sunazimuth}{sun azimuth in degrees}

\item{IL.epsilon}{a small amount to add to calculated illumination values 
that are equal to zero to avoid division by zero resulting in Inf values}

\item{slopeclass}{the slope classes to calculate k for (in radians), or 
NULL, in which case an algorithm will be used to choose reasonable defaults 
for the given image. If provided, \code{slopeclass} should be a list of 
slope class limits. For example: c(1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45) * (pi/180)}

\item{coverclass}{used to calculate k for specific cover class (optional)
as \code{RasterLayer}}

\item{sampleindices}{(optional) row-major indices of sample pixels to use in 
the calculation of k values for the Minnaert correction. See
\code{\link{gridsample}}.}

\item{DN_min}{minimum allowable pixel value after correction (values less 
than \code{DN_min} are set to NA)}

\item{DN_max}{maximum allowable pixel value after correction (values less 
than \code{DN_max} are set to NA)}
}
\value{
\code{RasterLayer} with topographically corrected data
}
\description{
Perform topographic correction using the Minnaert method. This code is 
modified from the code in the \code{landsat} package written by Sarah 
Goslee.  This version of the code has been altered from the \code{landsat} 
version to allow the option of using a sample of pixels for calculation of k 
in the Minnaert correction (useful when dealing with large images).

See the help page for \code{minnaert} in the \code{landsat} package for 
additional details on the parameters.
