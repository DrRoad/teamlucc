\title{Simplify a polygon to contain less than a certain number of vertices}
\usage{
simplify_polygon(poly_obj, max_vertices, maxit = 100, multiplier = 1.05,
  initial_tolerance = "dynamic")
}
\arguments{
\item{poly_obj}{a polygon as an sp object}

\item{max_vertices}{the maximum number of vertices to allow in the 
simplified polygon}

\item{maxit}{the maximum number of iterations to use to simplify the polygon}

\item{multiplier}{a number used to increase the tolerance for each 
subsequent iteration, if the number of vertices in the simplified polygon is 
not less than /code{max_vertices}}

\item{initial_tolerance}{initial value for tolerance used to remove vertices 
from polygon.  If set to the default option, "dynamic", the code will 
automatically set the \code{initial_tolerance} to .01 * the length of the 
diagonal of the bounding box of the polygon. \code{initial_tolerance} can 
also be set to an arbitrary value, in the same units as the polygon object.}
}
\value{
polygon with less than \code{max_vertices} vertices
}
\description{
Useful for simplifying area of interest (AOI) polygons for use with online 
data portals (like USGS EarthExplorer) that limit the number of vertices 
allowed in uploaded AOI shapefiles.
