\usage{
ee_plot(x, start_date, end_date, min_clear = 0.7, exclude = list(),
  normalize = FALSE, title = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{data.frame} with a list of Landsat scenes as output by
\code{\link{ee_read}}}

\item{start_date}{starting date as a \code{Date} object}

\item{end_date}{end date as a \code{Date} object}

\item{min_clear}{the minimum percent clear to plot (calculated as 1 - 
percent cloud cover). Images with less than \code{min_clear} fraction of the 
image area free of clouds will be ignored.}

\item{exclude}{a list of sensors to exclude (for example, set 
\code{exclude=c('LE7', 'LT4')} to exclude Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 4 TM 
images.}

\item{normalize}{if \code{TRUE}, plot as a normalized line plot}

\item{title}{title for plot (or \code{NULL} for no title)}
