\title{Automatically determine value for image thresholding}
\usage{
threshold(x, method = "huang", n_bin = 1000, maxpixels = 5e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the input image, as a matrix or raster}

\item{method}{the thresholding method. Currently only "huang" is 
implemented.}

\item{n_bin}{number of bins to use when calculating histogram}

\item{maxpixels}{maximum number of pixels size to use when calculating 
histogram}
}
\value{
integer threshold value
}
\description{
The only method currently implemented is Huang's fuzzy thresholding method.  
The code for Huang's method was ported to C++ for \code{teamlucc} from the 
code in the Auto_Threshold imageJ plugin by Gabriel Landini. See original 
code at:
http://www.mecourse.com/landinig/software/autothreshold/autothreshold.html
}
\details{
This function will run in parallel if a parallel backend is registered with 
\code{\link{foreach}}.
