\title{Draw a random sample from a grid laid out on a RasterLayer or matrix}
\usage{
gridsample(x, horizcells = 10, vertcells = 10, nsamp = 10,
  rowmajor = FALSE, replace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or RasterLayer to draw sample from}

\item{horizcells}{how many cells to break the raster in horizontally (over 
the columns)}

\item{vertcells}{how many cells to break the raster in vertically (over 
the rows)}

\item{nsamp}{how many samples to draw from each grid cell}

\item{rowmajor}{whether to return indices in row-major format (default is 
column-major). Row-major format is useful in conjunction with \code{Raster*} 
objects.}

\item{replace}{whether to sample with replacement (within each grid cell)}
}
\value{
vector of sample indices
}
\description{
This function is used to subsample a \code{RasterLayer} or \code{matrix} by 
dividing the dataset into a grid of \code{horizcells} x \code{vertcells}, 
and by then drawing a sample of size \code{nsamp} from within each grid 
cell.
}
\note{
TODO: Recode in C++ for speed.

\examples{
# Make a 100x100 matrix
x <- matrix(1:10000, nrow=100)
# Subsample the matrix by breaking it up into a 10 x 10 grid, and take 10
# random samples from each grid cell without replacement (these are the
# default parameters).
y <- gridsample(x)
}
