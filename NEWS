teamlucc 0.46
=============
* Fix U_REGEX_RULE_SYNTAX error in proj4comp due to stringr update.
* Add option in linear_stretch to do a standard deviation stretch.
* Fix base_img_index selection in auto_cloud_fill.
* Misc doc fixes and roxygenize.

teamlucc 0.44
=============
* Fix for bug where auto_preprocess_landsat only preprocessed the last image if 
  it detected multiple images.

teamlucc 0.42
=============
* Fix for "invalid multibyte read" error in ee_read on Linux (reported by 
  Martin Wegmann).
* Fix for bug in auto_preprocess_landsat with tc=TRUE for latest ESPA CDR image 
  formats.

teamlucc 0.40
=============
* Support all current ESPA CDR output formats for surface reflectance imagery 
  (ENVI, HDF-EOS2, and GeoTIFF).
* "auto_preprocess_landsat" now returns a list of the processed datafiles.
* Depend on glcm >= 1.0 (which properly handles images that can't fit in 
  memory).
* Warn when preprocessing of Landsat 8 images is attempted.
* Lots of R CMD check adjustments.
* Misc doc fixes.

teamlucc 0.38
=============
* Fix NA handling in classify, and allow parallel classification.
* Update for new "cfmask" band name in latest CDR imagery.
* Fix output datatype for fmasks from L1T imagery in auto_preprocess_landsat.
* Misc doc fixes.

teamlucc 0.36
=============
* For IDL dependent functions, add test if ENVI and IDL will load.
* Add support for Landsat 8 files that have been processed through fmask.
* Fix sensor strings to grep for "LC8" rather than "LE8" for Landsat 8.
* Make "lndsr." at beginning of HDF files optional as recent ESPA files don't 
  have this prefix (thanks to Stanley Okoro).
* Add support for factors to train_classifier and classify.
* Minor doc fixes.

teamlucc 0.34
=============
* Fix calculation of change direction in chg_dir.
* Support alreting shift and window size for GLCM calculation in 
  auto_calc_predictors.
* Specify number of bins in threshold code rather than "by" size.
* Misc R CMD check fixes.

teamlucc 0.32
=============
* Support passing additional arguments to glcm in auto_calc_predictors.
* Support passing additional arguments to cloud_remove_R or cloud_remove_IDL in 
  cloud_remove.

teamlucc 0.30
=============
* Change default DN_min and DN_max to 0 and 10000.
* Bugfix handling of out_name parameter in auto_cloud_fill.
* Fix bug in normalize related to attempted fix for setting output datatype.  
  Still need to work on this for a future release.
* Minor doc fixes.
